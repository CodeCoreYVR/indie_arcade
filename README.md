# IndieArcade - JSON Squad: CodeCore project

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/CodeCoreYVR/indie_arcade.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/CodeCoreYVR/indie_arcade)

Test tube project to create a free public arcade/computer to play indie games made in British Columbia.
Arcade would be connected to a cloud that stores/manages the game source code uploaded by the developers. The games are automatically added/updated from the cloud to the arcade weekly.
When the user presses play, the arcade chooses a random game available each time.
At the end of the game, user feedback and game stats are sent back to the game developers (free games testers).
